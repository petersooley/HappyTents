Preference Table
	Each line in preference table has three fields:
		1. camper name,
		2. mate name, and
		3. camper's rating of mate.
	Example: 
		alan      mike      1
		alan      felicia   0
		bob       jack      7

Tent List 
	Each line in the tent list represents a tent and specifies its capacity.
	Example with one 2-man tent and two 3-man and 4-man tents: 
		2
		3
		3
		4
		4
	NOTE: The lines are considered sorted. The search will start with the first line, then the second, etc.


Details
---------------------------------------------------------------
	I first tried to represent the traits as a tree, (not all at once, of course), where each depth was another 
camper placed into some tent and once a tent was full the remaining campers would be placed into the next tent
and so on until the tents were all filled at which point you can calculate the happiness of all the campers. 
However, one of the problems with this is that some states would be repeated. For example, Bob and Alan in the
same tent is no different than Alan and Bob in the same tent with all other tents remaining as they were. Their
happiness level will not change. To fix this and look at only the unique states, I adjusted the tree so that each 
depth is a tent with some combination (not permutation) of campers in it.
